This is the blog of QUIC-Tracker, an [open-source QUIC test suite][qt-source]. 

This blog will be regularly updated with posts about the new features available, tutorials on how to use the tool, and some insights on the metrics we collect.

QUIC-Tracker exchanges packets with IETF-QUIC implementations to verify whether an implementation conforms with the IETF specification of QUIC. The test suite consists of several test scenarii. Each of them aims at testing a particular feature of the QUIC protocol. The test suite runs daily, and its results are available [on this website][qt-home].

An article that summarise this work and the results that were gathered over a semester has been accepted at [CoNEXT EPIQ'18 workshop][epiq-18]. A version on [arXiv.org is already accessible][arxiv].
